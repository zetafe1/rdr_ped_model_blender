# RDR2 PED Models for Blender (Male & Female)

These PED models (one male and one female) were converted from Red Dead Redemption 2 and are intended for use in Blender as reference tools for Blender projects. 
The goal is to provide accurate human scale references to assist with proportions and spatial planning during development.

Usage Notes:

    These models are not rigged or optimized for animation.

    They are intended strictly for scale reference and layout design in Blender.

    These files are for non-commercial, educational, and personal use only.
